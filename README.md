## Inspiration
This was our first Hackathon! :)
"Holiday Hacks" is our Inspiration.  Holiday's can be tiresome when you are not ready for them, So we would like to bring you "Here for the Holiday's" which will make it easier to get ready for holiday's.
## What it does
It fetches ecards from an API (which was made by one of our team members) to be used by the user to share with friends and family. It also gives information about upcoming holidays on different days  and also the current holiday present and gift ideas to users.
## How we built it
Using  Reactjs ,Html ,CSS , Javascript, [link](https://holidayapi.com/)(Holiday API), [link](https://www.edamam.com/)(Edamam (Food) API),[link](https://holidayapi.com/)(Holiday API), [link](https://github.com/s-bhagwat/festival-api)(Festival API), Express, nodeJs 
## Challenges we ran into
While making this file, since we all are new to Mlh hackathons and React Js, we took time in fetching the APIs but later we were able to do it using axios
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Sarthak from our team created the API to fetch greetings randomly and Ecards (Right now it is a small database).
Learning new things has always been an Accomplishment to us! So participating in our first hackathon is an accomplishment in itself!
## What we learned
How to fetch API's in our React Projects.
How to create nodeJs API using express
How to use proxy in React in development environment, and use of build in Heroku deployment
## What's next for Holiday Is Here
Next we need to Expand the API, if we want to push it to production.
